# lang-features: Progress

- **Worktree**: `/Users/philippe/projects/techy/.claude/worktrees/agent-a01480fa109b19cef`
- **Branch**: `lang-features`
- **Plan**: see `dev-docs/langfeatures-plan/PLAN.md` (Design Spec is user-ruled; do not relitigate)

## Status

| Stage | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| D | Decision record [§dd-dr:lang-features] + ARCHITECTURE refs + superseded-names + CompileTimeFeatureGates.md status line | in-progress (awaiting review) |
| M1 | TokenRules/Overrides regrouped into per-feature blocks (pure reshaping, behavior identical) | pending |
| M2 | `Lang::Features` + const gating | pending |
| M3 | Uniform storage gating (FeaturePresence::Store) | pending |
| M4 | Docs, coherence sweep, closure (delete this directory) | pending |

## Log

(compact completion notes appended by each subagent: what was done, files touched, anything surprising)

- **Stage D implementer** — decision record written. New entry
  `[§dd-dr:lang-features]` added at the end of the "Parsing state and deltas"
  topic (`dev-docs/DESIGN_RATIONALE.md`, before "## Specs and scopes"): the
  compile-time axis + three motivations (memory measured-and-dropped, citing
  dev-docs/extra/CompileTimeFeatureGates.md), three spellings of off,
  exhaustive eight-feature roster with the ForbiddenChars two-axis supplement
  and Paragraphs-as-own-feature (reader runtime check promoted to
  `LangHasParagraphs: LangHasWhitespace`), independent gates + enforced edges
  (REJECTED closed tiers), total reads / bounded writes / crate-owned stores
  (REJECTED open implementation substitution — memo hash/equality stays
  crate-owned), gated overrides (REJECTED silent no-ops), sub-struct-granular
  struct-update pitfall, transparent present store, the naming set,
  LatexlikeLang pins AllLangFeatures. Cross-links added to
  [§dd-dr:token-rules-data]/[§dd-dr:data-vs-traits] to pre-empt a perceived
  contradiction (values stay data; only presence is compile-time).
  ARCHITECTURE.md: entry referenced from the [§dd-arch:state] decisions list
  and as new naming principle 8 in [§dd-arch:naming]. Superseded-names: one
  new bullet (`Gate`/`On`/`Off`; bare `Present`/`Absent`/`Has*`/`Features`;
  plus the public-vocabulary word ban ruled by the user — spelled out only in
  the register row itself). CompileTimeFeatureGates.md got the
  adopted-with-modifications status line pointing at the entry. Docs only, no
  src/ changes. Nothing surprising; one judgment call: the [§dd-arch:state]
  reference lives in the decisions list (not body prose) because ARCHITECTURE
  describes present-day structure and the M1–M3 code does not exist yet —
  M2/M4 should promote it into body text when it does.

## Questions for user

(genuine design ambiguities; the most conservative spec-consistent option was chosen and is noted here)

## Hand-off notes

(state a fresh supervisor needs beyond PLAN.md + this file + git log)
